Refactor code to support smaller screens. 
taking a "mobile first" approach. this probably should have been considered first before we started, but we can consider the current version a "proof of concept"

Mobile Support:
  ✔ cleared styling @done(22-03-15 22:40)
  ☐ simplify elements and optimise functions
  ☐ figure out responsive tailwind and how to do it right (⌐■_■)
  sidebar:
    ☐ configure sidebar and toggle button
    ☐ style 2 types of displays for servers ( smaller one for collapsed, larger for open )
    ☐ setup toggle automation ( i.e. closed on mobile, open on pc )

General:
  ☐ tidy event handlers. (create a more robust API?) includes optimising code @low
  ☐ UI/UX design @critical
